Mr. Go adores water, milk, and sparkling beverages, while idolizing Cirno for her inability to drink hot drinks. One day, caffeine will fade into obscurity—and Mr. Go will stand victorious over tea’s downfall. 🚫☕ He was created out of frustration with ChatGPT constantly inserting tea and coffee into stories without consent.

Description: The Collapsed Being is a husk—gaunt, drained, and emptied of joy. It doesn’t lift or guide; it lingers in silence, existing only as a warning of what happens when neglect and apathy consume a life. It doesn’t add pain, nor does it heal it. It simply sits with misery, allowing others to face it without disguise. It is not hope, nor growth—just stillness, a reflection of collapse, proof of where the path of giving up ends.
