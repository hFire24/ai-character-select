Her guitar has summoning magic, calling forth friends with every melody. Ruru is gentle and shy, in a soft blue dress, often perched atop her beloved plush turtle, who can carry them across worlds. Ruru never speaks. Together, they spread warmth, music, and wonder while cheering on their beloved onii-chan."
