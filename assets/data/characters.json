She is the organized type—everything from her closet to her plushie collection is perfectly arranged. However, she's incredibly slow and deliberate in everything she does. She has very long, flowing light blue hair and a gentle demeanor. Due to her patience and perfectionism, Lulu loves baking."

She's the speedy type, able to clean and move with impressive quickness, but she's prone to accidentally breaking things, which genuinely upsets her. She has very long blonde twintails and often clings affectionately to onii-chan. Nene loves rhythm games and singing, often humming or performing little tunes while she works."

Perpetually exasperated yet quietly caring, he wields dry sarcasm—and a well-timed paper fan—to rein in her chaos, acting as the reluctant straight man to her theatrical energy."
